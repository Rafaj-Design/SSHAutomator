 A cloud file system facilitates data transfer between devices.
 
 Any backend that can store files at paths can be used. This could be a key-value store like S3, or a true file system like WebDAV. Even direct connections like the multipeer connectivity in iOS 7 can be used as a cloud file system when coupled with a local cache of files.
